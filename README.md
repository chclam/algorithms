# Intro the Depth
Programming well is hard. Modern programming languages are convenient but black boxy. But this causes us distance ourselves more and more from the inner workings of technology.
This is an attempt at implementing simple algorithms in increasingly lower abstraction level of code. For each "algorithm" or rather "challenge", we first implement it in a language in a higher level language such as Python or Javascript, and then in C, and then in assembly.

A few challenges that I've set up for myself are the following.

  * Hello world
  * Insertionsort
  * Mergesort
